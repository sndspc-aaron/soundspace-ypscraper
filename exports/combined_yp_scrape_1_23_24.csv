We specialize in providing document and web site translations, on-site, simultaneous and consecutive interpretation, telephone interpretation, proof reading, editing of scientific papers, audio/video recording /voice over, transcription, localization, Desktop Publishing, teaching, film subtitling, interview research, etc. and related services.  Our agency currently employs over 2,000 Translators, Interpreters, Desktop Publishers, video/audio recorders (narrators/voiceover artists), etc. who support over 250 languages.  Our quality control system is well established, strict, and it is performed in many steps in order to ensure the highest quality review, translation, proofreading, editing, and certification process.  Our working system is not like that of a single freelance translator who translates the job by himself/herself and submits it to his/her client. In that case, there is no guarantee that the job is done accurately as there is no quality control mechanism which involves independent proofreader/editor, and quality control and formatting experts. The client has to take more of his/her time to find a proofreader.You will save time if you give us all your jobs.  In LTS, in order to assure the highest quality translation, and make sure that the formatting of the translated document is like the mirror image of the source document, at least three professionals (a translator, an independent proofreader/editor, and quality control and formatting experts) are involved in our working system.",http://www.yellowpages.com/federal-way-wa/mip/languages-translation-services-20944161?lid=1001710069091,https://i3.ypcdn.com/blob/65e544cebcd57f379ed23728372db4d719a434c4_228x168_crop.jpg

Nestled in the foothills of The Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee we are accessible not only by McGhee Tyson Airport of Knoxville, but Interstates 75 and 40 intersect in Knoxville, a short drive away, making it accessible by car from coast to coast and border to border. The studio has a main tracking room of 20 ft.x16 ft., a separate 9 ft.x8 ft. recording room, an isolated vocal booth, and a 10 ft.x12 ft. control room. We also have a lounge and full bath. This a musician-owned studio and we pride ourselves in offering a relaxed atmosphere with low pricing and quality results. Underground Recording recently won an award for the most courteous studio in Knoxville. We encourage your input and ideas during mixdown, while allowing the engineer to do the mix. Sometimes the musicians themselves want to make all of the mix decisions, but in many of these these cases the results have been less than what we are capable of doing. Basically, teamwork is the best policy for mixing. If possible, have an experienced producer accompany you, and together with the engineer your music will get the best mix. The equipment includes a Tascam MX2424, which is a 24-bit 24-track hard disc recorder. We also still have our 3 ADAT XTs with BRC for a secondary 24-track recording/editing system, and a Tascam MSR-16, which is a 16-track analog reel-to-reel recorder with remote. Our 2-track analog reel to reel mastering decks are a Tascam 32 ( which is running through a dbx 150 type 1 ), a Teac 2340 and a Sony TC-630. Our recording desk is a Soundcraft 32x8 Ghost Console w/MMC. We have over 2 dozen microphones including Neumann, AKG, Sennheiser, AT, Shure, Equitek, Oktava, and EV. Our large collection of outboard gear includes Lexicon, T.C. Electronics, Focusrite, Ashley, Aphex, dbx, Symetrix, Yamaha, Alesis, BBE and Fostex. Monitors are Event Trias in the main studio and KRK Rokit 8's in the control room. We also have a set of multimedia speakers in the control room...Altec Lansings with/subwoofer. For digital mastering we have Soundforge 8.0 w/plug-ins and for editing and automated mixing in our PC we have Pro Tools 7.4 w/plug-ins. For headphone monitoring we have a Q-Mix HM-6 Matrix Mixer which allows the listener to control their own mix individually. We also have 4 Rolls PM 50s headphone extension units which enable us to run a total of 10 headphones simultaeously. Our headphones include 5 Sennheiser HD 202's, 5 AKG K-55's, and 1 Sony MDR 7502. For the engineer we have 1 AKG K240. Our patchbays are balanced Furmans. Our CD player is a professional Marantz PMD320, our DAT machine is a Tascam DA-30, and our cassette deck is a Tascam 202MXII. We also have a 4X CD duplicator, a Tascam CD-D4000. Our computer is a custom made dual core Pentium 4 with a 3 gig processor, a 120 gig 10, 000 rpm Seagate hard drive and 2 extra 20 gig drives for backups. We are running Windows XP Pro. The CD/DVD writer is a 52X Sony. Our line conditioners are Furman and Juice Goose. Our power regulators are APC UPS's, which give clean sine wave tracking for all of the studio power. We encourage your band to bring it's own instruments for two reasons. First, you will get your personal sound that you are familiar with, and second, if you use the studio instruments you are liable for any damage which occurs. For that reason we offer free setup/micing time of your gear for up to 90 minutes. Our instruments include for drums, a 5-piece Ludwig kit with Zyldjan and Sabian cymbals. For electric guitars, we have a Fender Strat, a B.C. Rich Gunslinger, and a Gibson/Epiphone SG. For acoustic guitar we have a Yamaha 6-string, and for bass we have a Fender Squire 4-string. Our piano is a 1927 Gulbransen Baby Grand, and we have a 1987 Akai AX-80 keyboard. Our amps",http://www.yellowpages.com/seymour-tn/mip/underground-recording-studio-19738131,

His work has been heard around the world, but he would rather you listen to his work rather than look at his reputation. Bring your previously recorded tracks to Josh and let him return to you an album mix quality that would cost $25,000 from an in demand engineer.  Zach is a multi-instrumentalist who has performed on stages across Europe, as well as in Nashville and Atlanta. He has a B.S. in Recording Industry from MTSU, but aside from these accolades, Zach has worked on several tracks that received radio attention. Along with a great knowledge of recording and mixing audio, he brings the bonus of music theory and production.

Grammy Award winning mastering engineer Michael Graves has been working with analog media most of his life. He founded Osiris Studio in 2002 and has worked with hundreds of clients converting and preserving audio. Those clients include record labels, museums and archives, and personal collections. Because of the nature of most of the projects with which he works ( rare, one-of-a-kind recordings, deteriorating media, etc. ) Michael Graves operates his business with this basic philosophy: to provide his customers with the highest quality product he possibly can, because there may not be another chance to do so. This goal is achieved by a comprehensive knowledge of all aging media types, using only the best possible playback equipment, employing uncompromising analog to digital converters and delivering the final audio on a media format that is archivally stable, useable and best suited to the customer's needs. If any form of digital audio restoration is required ( tape de-hiss, record noise removal, etc. ) Osiris Studio employs the use of CEDAR. CEDAR is the best, most natural sounding noise removal software/hardware available. Its ability to remove unwanted noise from a recording while maintaining the integrity of the original sound is unequaled in the field of audio restoration.",http://www.yellowpages.com/atlanta-ga/mip/osiris-studio-27128901,

We also stock Used Cd's, some New Cd.'s, Turntables, and other Record playback equipment. Used Vinyl comes and goes and can not be re-ordered, so we only sell our used vinyl in our store and this website is more of an information and education platform. Visit Randy's Records frequently for the best chances to find the one of a kind and rare titles that you would Love to Add to your Collection! We buy all genres (styles/categories) of music and will purchase entire collections, large or small.  Condition is very important and is a major factor in determining a records value. Some titles sell better and for more than others due to supply and demand. Randy has been buying and reselling vinyl, here at the shop, for over 33 years. This experience allows us to pay higher on collectible and in demand vinyl. With our unique access to many serious collectors and thousands of customers, we can pay very fair prices because we've got the knowledge to back it up. Give us a call and let's talk about what records you have.  We also buy fully functioning record players, turntables and other analog stereo equipment like amplifiers/receivers (generally, they must have a phono input),  speakers and reel to reel players and reels. We also offer an in-house recording service of analog LP's, 45?s,  78rpm's and Cassette Tapes digitized to Audio CD. You must provide the analog source for the recording. The recording service fee for each full length LP record or Cassette Tape is $30+tax, but home recorded cassettes are charged by the amount of material recorded on them. The fee for each 45 single or 78rpm is $15. It takes at least 24 hours to get back any analog recording. If you have any questions about this service, please feel free to call the shop during business hours.

The Engineer/Producer/Composer 
Equipment  and facilities are important, but the best facility and equipment is  useless without the right person behind the desk.  Co-owner and lead  engineer, Chris Jensen, has spent his life studying music and working in  the industry.  Chris earned his B.A. in Music Performance and Music  Business at University of Georgia, studied Music Production at  Sacramento City College, and completed the Digital Studio Production  program at Pyramind in San Francisco. 
 
In addition to his  extensive education, Chris has been a working musician composing and  performing with various organizations, groups and bands covering nearly  every genre from classical to rock to metal to electronic.  With a wide  breadth of experience, Chris knows what various projects should sound  like and how to make them sound as best as possible.  Chris is easily  Red Light Recording's greatest asset.  Whether he's playing the role of  engineer, producer, songwriter/composer or any combination of the three;  Chris's experience, skill and passion shines through in all his work.",http://www.yellowpages.com/salt-lake-city-ut/mip/red-light-recording-481494503,

We also stock Used Cd's, some New Cd.'s, Turntables, and other Record playback equipment. Used Vinyl comes and goes and can not be re-ordered, so we only sell our used vinyl in our store and this website is more of an information and education platform. Visit Randy's Records frequently for the best chances to find the one of a kind and rare titles that you would Love to Add to your Collection! We buy all genres (styles/categories) of music and will purchase entire collections, large or small.  Condition is very important and is a major factor in determining a records value. Some titles sell better and for more than others due to supply and demand. Randy has been buying and reselling vinyl, here at the shop, for over 33 years. This experience allows us to pay higher on collectible and in demand vinyl. With our unique access to many serious collectors and thousands of customers, we can pay very fair prices because we've got the knowledge to back it up. Give us a call and let's talk about what records you have.  We also buy fully functioning record players, turntables and other analog stereo equipment like amplifiers/receivers (generally, they must have a phono input),  speakers and reel to reel players and reels. We also offer an in-house recording service of analog LP's, 45?s,  78rpm's and Cassette Tapes digitized to Audio CD. You must provide the analog source for the recording. The recording service fee for each full length LP record or Cassette Tape is $30+tax, but home recorded cassettes are charged by the amount of material recorded on them. The fee for each 45 single or 78rpm is $15. It takes at least 24 hours to get back any analog recording. If you have any questions about this service, please feel free to call the shop during business hours.

We have six engineers on staff and one is always available should you need assistance. If you are looking to track, mix, overdub or transfer material, our engineers can help. With the addition of our studio manager Juanita Copeland in August 2006, Sound Emporium has entered yet another era. Since her arrival, we have made a number of changes and improvements including a new console in Studio A, a revamp of B control room, new flooring and paint throughout the studio, new gear, and many other behind the scenes updates ( including this website ). We look forward to sharing these with you as we continue to make our studio even better. For more information about us, please visit the various links on our site.

We are structured to provide a comprehensive service that begins with the recording and continues through the delivery of your finished media. This means that you have one point of contact for your project from start to finish. Since our first days in 1975, we have focused on providing our services to music programs and ensembles engaged in the performance of historic and current fine arts literature in the choral/vocal, wind, string and jazz mediums: The business began as an avocation for DuWayne ( Dewey ) Kloos. Dewey was a public school music director who was interested in recording and in 1973 started to do serious recording of school groups in his district. Colleagues asked him to do other recording jobs and what began as a hobby became a business in 1975. In addition to his teaching duties, Dewey began operating a professional recording service that catered to the school, church, and community music group market with vinyl LP records produced from the recordings. Dewey joined a consortium of individuals with similar businesses that existed to get volume-buying discounts for vinyl record mastering and pressing. This association, known then as Mark Custom Records, had grown out of the Century Custom Recording organization. ( as a side note, another offshoot of Century Custom Recording is the well-known audiophile label Telarc ). When the Minnesota affiliates of Mark Custom Records broke ties with the central office in New York they chose the name Westmark as a way to both maintain name recognition and underscore their mutual location west of the Mississippi. Other members of the original Westmark consortium were Don Geiken in Moorhead, Al Opland in Pipestone, and Herb Streitz in Waseca. In time the vinyl LP was replaced by the audio cassette as the medium of choice for clients served by the business. Cassettes, unlike vinyl records, could be profitably duplicated locally and the need for the consortium faded away. Dewey eventually was operating as an independent business, and with the retirements of the other Midwest associates became the sole remaining bearer of the Westmark name. The name was updated to Westmark Productions as the business moved away from vinyl records to audio and video cassettes, compact discs and DVDs. The business had been growing steadily, and with the added time available to take on work, the rate of growth increased. In 1997 Dewey began to investigate the sale of the business in anticipation of his retirement. In January of 1999 he entered into an agreement with Doug Geston to sell the business. After a six-month apprenticeship We continue to provide our clients with high quality audio and video recording and production services with a staff of two full-time and two part-time employees and a large cadre of experienced recording personnel. Over the years we have expanded our offerings to include multi-track audio recording, video recording and editing and DVD production, all with the same quality and attention to detail that has made Westmark the largest recording and production service of its kind in Minnesota.",http://www.yellowpages.com/minneapolis-mn/mip/westmark-productions-18721663,

The title of the song means simply to pass on the knowledge that YOU have obtained in your life to others. This tribute to teachers is a statement and acknowledgement of HOW important they are to US. We face a brighter future if we care for those WHO have shared and advised US to become better. We are responsible for OUR actions and because of this we should take responsibility for OUR future generations. Education is the KEY to real freedom. Please remember to Teach The Dream. Sincerely.

The group is made up of members: Marvin ""The MarTian"" Haskins, Shawn Dough, and Adrian ""Trey Drum"" Griffin, which have a very clear objective to develop clients careers providing them with industry sound results from Music Demos, Albums, Mixtapes, Extended Players, Debut Singles, Instrumentals, Songwriting, Featured Gigs, including Drops or Effects.  Our work as a Record Producer may include: selecting music and contacting musicians, identifying music with commercial potential, setting the budget and recording schedule, negotiating and signing contracts with performers and with the artists and repertoire (A&R) departments of music publishers or record companies, engineering the recording, delivering the product to the A&R department of the company, all within budget and on schedule.  The collaborative nature of music production means that Producers work with a wide variety of people, including performers, writers, arrangers, lawyers, accountants and distributors. Hours are long and irregular, often including evenings and weekends.  Many Producers work on a freelance basis and are paid a flat fee for recording sessions, possibly with an agreed percentage (often between three and four percent) of the income from future sales, so income can vary from next to nothing to tens of thousands of dollars. Producers may also be employed by a record label or music production company.",http://www.yellowpages.com/buffalo-ny/mip/select-music-group-531255057,

Jerry, being an accomplished musician, educator, and recording professional, saw the need for a professional audio mastering and editing studio to provide services previously unavailable regionally. Terra Nova was the first of its kind in the central Texas area, and has been totally committed to providing the services our clients need to fulfill their creative visions and to bring their projects to a complete professional level. Through the evolution of Terra Nova, the client list has grown to grand proportions, and the commitment to high quality continues, the same as the day the business began. The mastering process is an essential step for a polished, professional product. The sound is everything. This high tech digital age has elevated the ""ears"" of the average listener to a high level of sophistication. The average listener may not be able to measure exactly why one CD sounds better than another, but they know there is a difference. Sonic quality is our main concern. Our engineers have exceptional abilities at analyzing the sonic quality of audio productions. We are specialists at getting the best results for our client's recordings. We have mastered virtually every genre of music and spoken word, and our engineers are also experts at archiving and restoration. When a client has completed the recording and mixing of a project, the mastering process is the next step toward a complete professional sound. When a client contacts Terra Nova about scheduling a session, they will need to tell the staff the final mix format, the length of the project ( in minutes ), the number of tracks, the format the project will be mastered for ( i.e., DVD Surround, CD, or vinyl duplication ). It is helpful if the client knows his/her goals for their particular project, whether they are planning to sell CD's or DVD's to the public, for promotional or demo purposes, to get a record label interested, or for the client's own enjoyment. Having this information when contacting Terra Nova to set up a session will enable the staff to give an estimate of the time and money that will be involved. The client can then plan a budget. Our staff is always ready to provide our clients with the best, most professional service that they deserve. We are here to help our clients realize their full potential as artists. Terra Nova Digital Audio, Inc moved into new facilities in July of 2002. The new studio is located about 8 miles west of downtown Austin, Texas, in the Oak Hill area. Our new location is easily accessible from all areas, major freeways, and about 20 minutes from the airport. Our facilities provide a spacious, comfortable, and relaxed atmosphere for the clients. We have two mastering suites, including complete DVD surround mastering capabilities. We are just minutes from restaurants and overnight accommodations",http://www.yellowpages.com/austin-tx/mip/terra-nova-digital-audio-6924715,https://i1.ypcdn.com/blob/561ec8574d501029d1951a0340c97aeeba1c74da_228x168_crop.jpg

This humble studio consisted of a 2-track Analog recorder, mono reel-to-reel dubbing equipment, an eight-channel mixing board, two microphones, a few tape machines, a desk, and a couch. As the years progressed AMERISOUND took on more clients and, as a result, expanded its studio in 1980 to include: 700 more square feet, an 8-track recorder, a 16-channel mixing board, dozens of microphones, a drum kit, a piano, a new desk, and the same couch. Just five years later AMERISOUND expanded again to an 1800 sq. ft. studio that offered 24-track recording, and new mixing equipment ( They even bought three new couches! ). By this time AMERISOUND had become a full-service operation for both the advertising world and musicians alike offering tape duplication and state of the art recording technology. Furthermore, it was at this location where AMERISOUND created jingle packages for such firms as Wendy's International and Bank One. AMERISOUND was also involved with album projects for Warner Brothers, EMI, Malaco Records, and Itchibon Records. In March of 1996 AMERISOUND made its final move to its present location in Hilliard, Ohio. This state-of-the-art facility includes over 3, 000 sq. ft. of studio, recording, and recreational space ( not to mention the full-sized kitchen! ).",http://www.yellowpages.com/columbus-oh/mip/amerisound-recording-studio-3162427,

Aircraft stays contemporary while delivering, not only classical, jazz, blues, rock and other mainstream music, but music styles unique to the production world like ""corporate background"", ""sports"", ""humor' and ""entertainment themes"". Drop in the enclosed demo CD and you'll begin to understand the great pains we've taken to make sure the AirCraft Music Library is the most ""Use-able"" production music library on the market today. Aircraft's use-ability doesn't end there. For the broadcast producer, AirCraft Music Library tracks come edited in: 60,: 30, and often stinger lengths. Corporate producers will appreciate the advantages of having alternate ( no melody ) mixes that duck nicely under your voiceover during complicated messages. Many of the cuts in our library are also available as split tracks for the DIY producer No matter what your production music needs are, we're confident you'll find the right tracks in the Aircraft Music Library, whether you' re looking for a string quartet, a delta blues guitar, funky urban, or that ""alternative but not too alternative"" rock track. Call us today to find out about our flexible music licensing options. We offer annual blanket licenses, needledrop plans, and we even have several smaller specialty packages available as buyouts. Contact us by email or call 1-800-343-2514 for a rate quote. ( International users call +1-617-303-7600 )",http://www.yellowpages.com/boston-ma/mip/aircraft-production-music-779233,

Our vision is to nurture the spiritual and economic growth of the people of Philadelphia and the surrounding areas by increasing access to cultural, global, vocational, technological and civic learning through the arts. 
 
 
Our primary goal is to develop and deliver the highest standards of performing arts education, integrating the perspectives of diverse cultures of the world and instilling: 
 
 
* Confidence  
* Collaboration skills  
* Creativity  
* Conflict resolution skills  
* Communication skills  
* Citizenship skills 
 
 
CEG students benefit the most: When they try a variety of classes. While a student may be tempted to focus her/his class schedule in a specific discipline, it is better to acquire a diverse arts background and to become a well-rounded performer and/or technician. A broad understanding of performing and production arts can help artists realize their creative goals. For this reason, we encourage students to enroll in a variety of performing and production arts classes. 
 
 
Each season over 100 students participate in the many programs of CEG. No Experience is Necessary. That's why we are here to teach them everything they ever wanted to know about the performing arts. They will have fun in a relaxed, enthusiastic atmosphere, learning alongside other students of their age and skill level. Under the direction of professional artists and teachers.",http://www.yellowpages.com/philadelphia-pa/mip/ceg-performing-arts-academy-2731033?lid=1000437169411,https://i2.ypcdn.com/blob/0cb05f41e7f8cc1fb0aed74f2cc64c71a2bd5767_228x168_crop.jpg

SESAC will represent the right for your music to be played in public. Songwriters and publishers are paid royalties based upon how much their songs are played. The system required to compute compensation is based on many factors, including state-of-the-art monitoring, computer database information and broadcast logs. Unlike ASCAP and BMI, SESAC utilizes a selective process when affiliating songwriters and publishers, resulting in a roster of affiliates who have personal relationships with the SESAC staff. In short, SESAC's creative staff provides affiliated songwriters and publishers with a level of service and attention unparalleled in the industry.

After facing a layoff from the Lockheed-Martin Aircraft Manufacturing plant, Carl saw this studio as a new direction from God. As an unusual musician himself not only could he play practically any music he heard, he could explain clearly how he did it. Carl knew that capable pianists and organists are difficult, and in some areas, impossible to find. and he felt that God wanted him to use that gift to supply churches with capable, dedicated musicians. With this in mind, Carl Kenerly founded Kenerly Music Studio Kenerly Music Studio now has a staff of five teachers, all trained by Carl himself. Nearly 100 students come for lessons on any given week. Countless church musicians in Fort Worth ( and surrounding areas ) give gushing accolades when asked about getting their start Kenerly Music Studio As a piano teacher for the past 20 years, Mr. Kenerly has learned the importance of motivating children and young adults to love the piano at every skill level. He teaches all aspects of piano technique and artistry, including music theory, mainly with gospel music. He teaches how to play the piano to the children of exceptional parents who want their children to be successful musicians, and proud of their accomplishments. Regardless of your age, background or style'his goal is to help you to learn, progress and enjoy the music within you.",http://www.yellowpages.com/fort-worth-tx/mip/kenerly-music-studio-22282054,https://i2.ypcdn.com/blob/eb37e6d5b06b0fb122486b784b030b64fc5ba89d_228x168_crop.jpg

Most engineers have access to decent gear, and a decent studio.  What sets us apart is our ears, taste, and musicality.  As an experienced musician myself, I'm able to address your song in its entirety, and not just the sound of the instruments.  I believe in going deep into a songs notes, its lyrics, and the feel of it.  I want to make sure the song doesn't give mixed signals, and that it's clear to the listener what they should be feeling.    Of course, I enjoy the entire process of recording and refining music.  I absolutely love mixing, and believe I'm very good at it.  However, the best mix in the world isn't going to help a poorly written or composed song.  I've found that if more effort is put into ensuring that the song is A+ material, the more I am able to help set the clients I work with apart from other artists.",http://www.yellowpages.com/glendale-az/mip/arizona-music-producer-steve-burns-525861397,https://i3.ypcdn.com/blob/ef796d434312159f724f9a8e7cb63738dda7bf76_228x168_crop.jpg
